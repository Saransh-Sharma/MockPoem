            "    \"content\": \"Twas at the camp of Rorke's Drift, and at tea-time,\\nAnd busily engaged in culinary operations was a private of the line;\\nBut suddenly he paused, for he heard a clattering din,\\nWhen instantly two men on horseback drew rein beside him. \\n\\n\\\"News from the front!\\\" said one, \\\"Awful news!\\\" said the other,\\n\\\"Of which, we are afraid, will put us to great bother,\\nFor the black Zulus are coming, and for our blood doth thirst,\\\"\\n\\\"And the force is cut up to pieces!\\\" shouted the first. \\n\\n\\\"We're dead beat,\\\" said both, \\\"but we've got to go on,\\\"\\nAnd on they rode both, looking very woebegone;\\nThen Henry Hook put all thought of cooking out of his mind,\\nFor he was surrounded with danger on every side he did find. \\n\\nHe was a private of the South Wales Borderers, Henry Hook,\\nAlso a brave soldier, and an hospital cook;\\nA soldier of the Queen, who was always ready to obey,\\nAnd willing to serve God by night and day. \\n\\nThen away to the Camp he ran, with his mind all in a shiver,\\nShouting, \\\"The force is cut up, sir, on the other side of the river!\\\"\\nWhich caused the officer in command with fear to quiver,\\nWhen Henry Hook the news to him did deliver. \\n\\nThen Henry Hook saluted, and immediately retired,\\nAnd with courage undaunted his soul was fired,\\nAnd the cry rang out wildly, \\\"The Zulus are coming!\\\"\\nThen the alarm drums were instantly set a-drumming. \\n\\nThen \\\"Fall in! Fall in!\\\" the commanders did cry,\\nAnd the men mustered out, ready to do and to die,\\nAs British soldiers are always ready to do,\\nBut, alas, on this occasion their numbers were but few. \\n\\nThey were only eighty in number, that brave British band,\\nAnd brave Lieutenant Broomhead did them command;\\nHe gave orders to erect barricades without delay,\\n\\\"It's the only plan I can see, men, to drive four thousand savages away.\\\" \\n\\nThen the mealie bags and biscuit boxes were brought out,\\nAnd the breastwork was made quickly without fear or doubt,\\nAnd barely was it finished when some one cried in dismay,\\n\\\"There's the Zulus coming just about twelve hundred yards away.\\\" \\n\\nMethinks I see the noble hero, Henry Hook,\\nBecause like a destroying angel he did look,\\nAs he stood at the hospital entrance defending the patients there,\\nBayoneting the Zulus, while their cries rent the air,\\nAs they strove hard the hospital to enter in,\\nBut he murdered them in scores, and thought it no sin. \\n\\nIn one of the hospital rooms was stationed Henry Hook,\\nAnd every inch a hero he did look,\\nStanding at his loophole he watched the Zulus come,\\nAll shouting, and yelling, and at a quick run. \\n\\nOn they came, a countless host of savages with a rush,\\nBut the gallant little band soon did their courage crush,\\nBut the cool man Henry Hook at his post began to fire,\\nAnd in a short time those maddened brutes were forced to retire. \\n\\nStill on came the savages into the barricade,\\nAnd still they were driven back, but undismayed.\\nAgain they came into the barricade, yet they were driven back,\\nWhile darkness fell swift across the sun, dismal and black. \\n\\nThen into the hospital the savages forced their way,\\nAnd in a moment they set fire to it without dismay,\\nThen Henry Hook flew\\\" to assist the patients in the ward,\\nAnd the fighting there was fearful and hard. \\n\\nWith yell and shriek the Zulus rushed to the attack,\\nBut for the sixth time they were driven back\\nBy the brave British band, and Henry Hook,\\nWho was a brave soldier, surgeon, and hospital cook. \\n\\nAnd when Lord Chelmsford heard of the victory that day,\\nHe sent for Henry Hook without delay,\\nAnd they took the private before the commander,\\nAnd with his braces down, and without his coat, in battle array grandeur. \\n\\nThen Lord Chelmsford said, \\\"Henry Hook, give me your hand,\\nFor your conduct to day has been hereoic and grand,\\nAnd without your assistance to-day we'd been at a loss,\\nAnd for your heroic behaviour you shall receive the Victoria Cross.\\\"\",\n" +
